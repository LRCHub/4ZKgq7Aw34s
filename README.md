[00:18.01] Could you spare a second, slow your pace, listen
[00:22.64] To the story of Cartethyia
[00:27.08] She called for freedom, she yearned for legend
[00:31.50] Dreaming of splendid adventure
[00:46.50] 
[00:36.28] Will the prophecy manifest
[00:40.59] Will I be the maiden who's blessed
[00:57.59] 
[00:44.55] Then I'll walk down the glory path
[00:49.34] Bring honor and brightness back
[00:54.19] Wipe out all the enemies in sight
[00:58.04] There's no turning back this time
[01:01.91] Will it realize, will it realize
[01:06.50] Will the laurel be placed on my head
[01:11.55] One day we shall cheer and dance
[01:16.33] Making joy forever last
[01:27.83] 
[01:30.02] The prophecy is nothing but a vicious lie
[01:34.54] Here comes the growling dark tide
[01:38.68] The more pain she feels, the clearer she sees
[01:43.54] Haloes of divine are fading
[01:57.04] 
[01:48.08] I can hear the bell of fate sounds
[01:52.44] It's high time to turn it around
[02:08.44] 
[01:56.44] I'll carry on my glorious journey
[02:00.59] With the blessings and wish by my side
[02:06.09] Won't accept the fate that is set
[02:10.35] There's no turning back this time
[02:14.04] This will realize, it will realize
[02:18.31] Truth in my heart never dies
[02:23.83] I'll pierce through all the veils of lies
[02:28.26] With this silver sword in my hand, hand
[02:47.76] 
[02:33.15] Divinity blindfolded me
[02:37.55] Wrapped me in lies like ocean's mist
[02:42.10] I'm still that girl, carrying the hopes
[02:46.36] I'll break the shackles
[02:48.40] Free the souls trapped in those dark worlds
[03:09.90] 
[02:58.59] Nothing can stop me walking down this path
[03:02.96] Bringing honor and blessings back
[03:08.18] Won't accept the fate that is set
[03:12.27] There's no turning back this time
[03:15.92] Will it be true, will it be true
[03:20.22] Be a closure for this myth book
[03:25.87] One day we shall cheer and dance
[03:30.16] Making joy forever last
