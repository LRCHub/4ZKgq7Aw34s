[00:18.27] Could you spare a second?
[00:20.59] [00:20.599] Slow your pace, listen
[00:22.61] [00:22.610] To the story of Cartethyia
[00:27.03] [00:27.033] She called for freedom
[00:29.41] [00:29.411] She yearned for legend
[00:31.61] [00:31.613] Dreaming of splendid adventure
[00:36.14] [00:36.149] Will the prophecy manifest?
[00:40.52] [00:40.529] Will I be the maiden who is blessed?
[00:44.22] [00:44.224] Then I'll walk down the glory path
[00:49.29] [00:49.292] Bring honor and brightness back
[00:54.18] [00:54.180] Wipe out all the enemies in sight
[00:58.31] [00:58.311] There is no turning back this time
[01:02.09] [01:02.099] Will it realize? Will it realize?
[01:06.51] [01:06.512] Will the Laurel be placed on my head?
[01:11.84] [01:11.848] One day, we shall cheer and dance
[01:16.34] [01:16.347] Making joy forever last
[01:30.11] [01:30.117] Prophecy is nothing
[01:32.33] [01:32.332] But a vicious lie
[01:34.62] [01:34.622] Here comes the growling Dark Tide
[01:39.06] [01:39.061] The more pain she feels
[01:41.29] [01:41.299] The clearer she sees
[01:43.70] [01:43.704] Halos of divine are fading
[01:48.14] [01:48.144] I can hear the bell of fate sound
[01:52.61] [01:52.615] It's high time to turn it around
[01:56.51] [01:56.516] I'll carry on my glorious journey
[02:00.54] [02:00.545] With the blessings and wish by my side
[02:05.97] [02:05.975] Won't accept the fate that is set
[02:10.25] [02:10.255] There is no turning back this time
[02:14.00] [02:14.001] This will realize, it will realize
[02:18.37] [02:18.376] Truth in my heart never dies
[02:23.71] [02:23.713] I'll pierce through all the veils of lies
[02:28.09] [02:28.096] With the silver sword in my hand
[02:33.71] [02:33.715] Divinity, blindfolded me
[02:37.70] [02:37.701] Wrapped me in lies, like ocean's mist
[02:42.33] [02:42.333] I'm still that girl, carrying the hopes
[02:46.61] [02:46.618] I'll break the shackles
[02:48.60] [02:48.607] Free the souls trapped in those dark worlds
[02:58.72] [02:58.724] Nothing can stop me walking down this path
[03:03.26] [03:03.263] Bringing honor and blessings back
[03:07.94] [03:07.940] Won't accept the fate that is set
[03:12.17] [03:12.179] There is no turning back this time
[03:16.07] [03:16.078] Will it be true? Will it be true?
[03:20.30] [03:20.306] Be a closure for this myth book
[03:25.79] [03:25.791] One day, we shall cheer and dance
[03:30.11] [03:30.112] Making joy forever last
